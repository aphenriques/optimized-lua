# Optimizations

* tuned compiler flags:
  * set optimization level 3 (-O3)
  * enable link time optimization (-flto)
  * enable all instruction subsets supported by the local machine (-march=native)
* computed goto:
  * Miro Knejp's https://github.com/mknejp/computed-goto
  * check out his excelent talk ["Non-conforming C++: the Secrets the Committee Is Hiding From You" on CppCon 2019](https://youtu.be/IAdLwUXRUvg) where he explains computed goto starting on [31:17](https://youtu.be/IAdLwUXRUvg?t=1877) (Lua implementation starts on [40:12](https://youtu.be/IAdLwUXRUvg?t=2412)
